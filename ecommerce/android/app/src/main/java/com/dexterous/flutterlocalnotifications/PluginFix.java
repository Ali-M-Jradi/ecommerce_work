/**
 * IMPORTANT: FLUTTER LOCAL NOTIFICATIONS PLUGIN FIX
 * 
 * This file serves as documentation to explain the fix for the 
 * flutter_local_notifications plugin.
 * 
 * The issue occurs in the FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.java file where there is 
 * an ambiguous call to bigLargeIcon(null) in newer versions of the plugin.
 * 
 * THE SOLUTION:
 * -------------
 * We have downgraded flutter_local_notifications to version 16.0.0+1 in pubspec.yaml
 * which is compatible with our current setup.
 * 
 * If the issue persists, you can manually fix it by editing the plugin source:
 * 
 * 1. Locate the FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.java file in your .pub-cache:
 *    C:/Users/[USERNAME]/AppData/Local/Pub/Cache/hosted/pub.dev/flutter_local_notifications-x.y.z/android/src/main/java/com/dexterous/flutterlocalnotifications/
 *
 * 2. Find the line with:
 *    bigPictureStyle.bigLargeIcon(null);
 * 
 * 3. Replace it with:
 *    // Handle API compatibility
 *    if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.S) {
 *        bigPictureStyle.bigLargeIcon((android.graphics.drawable.Icon)null);
 *    } else {
 *        bigPictureStyle.bigLargeIcon((android.graphics.Bitmap)null);
 *    }
 * 
 * 4. Build your app again
